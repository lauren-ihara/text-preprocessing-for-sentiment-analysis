This code is the first step in sentiment analysis. 

Order of operations:
1. Load required libraries; nltk is the best package here
2. Import data and explore
3. Create buckets for easier processing of ratings
4. Define the preprocessing function
   - Remove: puctuation, stop words, etc.
   - Check for positive and negative sentiment BASED ON THE SCRIPT YOU DEFINED
7. Create a word cloud (b/c it's fun)
8. Train, evaluate, and predict sentiment analysis using a model
   - Model selected: Decision Tree Classifier
   - Check accuracy score
   - Check confusion matrix
